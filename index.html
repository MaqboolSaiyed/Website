        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Since my childhood itself, I had a great deal of interest in Computers and Stuff. later as I grew up I started to develop an interest in  Programming Languages but rater there was one thing among all the coding and programming languages that kept me on the edge was Web Development. I just love to mess around with codes and also create new things that can be put on the Web. I have been practicing HTML & CSS for quite a long time now. And I am aiming to learn new Web Dev skills as soon as possible.</p>

        <img class="gamer-img" src="controller.png" alt="game-img">
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Gaming is something that I just love to do other than Web Development that is. I have played a lot of games to date, but I would any day choose FPS games over any other game. I am currently playing BGMI and Critical Ops. also I grew up playing CS and GTA, well that was a golden era in my sense.</p>

      <img class="writer-img" src="pen.png" alt="writer-img" >
        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p> Other than those things I am also fond of writing. I love to write poems or rather 2-3 lines motivational quotes type of thing. Well, one can say I try to uncover the reality of this world using words on a piece of paper rather than saying it.</p>
